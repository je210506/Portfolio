      I'm currently studying finance, but I've always had an interest in software development, which is why I’ve started exploring it more seriously. I’m curious to see how I can combine my knowledge of finance with software development in the long run, creating opportunities that align with both fields. Right now, I’m keeping an open mind and seeing where this journey takes me, excited about the possibilities and ready to embrace new challenges along the way.
