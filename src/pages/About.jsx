      I am currently studying finance, but I have always had an interest in software development, which is why Iâ€™ve started exploring it more seriously. I am curious to see how I can combine my knowledge of finance with software development in the long run, creating opportunities that align with both fields. Right now, I am keeping an open mind and seeing where this journey takes me, excited about the possibilities and ready to embrace new challenges along the way.
